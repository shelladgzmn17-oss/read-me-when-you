      `Hi baby, please think about how far you’ve come and how many times you’ve made me proud without even trying. You’ve already overcome so much, and this moment is no different. I believe in you, even on the days you don’t believe in yourself. Take things one step at a time. You don’t need to be perfect, you just need to keep going. I’m so proud of you, always.`,

      `Hi baby, breathe for a second. It’s okay to feel this way. Your feelings are valid, and you don’t have to carry them alone, you always have me. Whatever your mind is telling you right now, remember this: you are loved, you matter, and you are enough. Breathe slowly. This feeling will pass, and I’ll still be here. I will love you until the end of my life—on easy days and hard ones, always.`,

      `Hi baby ko! Please always remember that you are never alone. I’m always with you. Remember how it feels when we cuddle? Safe, warm, and calm. That’s how I feel about you all the time. Even when I’m not there, my love is always with you. BIG BIG HUGGGGG 🤍`,

      `I know things can get overwhelming, and it’s okay to feel angry or upset. Pause for a moment. Breathe. Remember how our bahay dates calm us down? That’s how just being together makes everything feel lighter. I’m always here, ready to listen and understand you. KISS PLS 😘`,

      `Hi baby, don’t forget to drink your meds please! I wish I could be right there taking care of you. Rest well and be gentle with yourself. You don’t need to be strong right now, just focus on getting better. Get well soon, my love. I miss you so muchhh!`,

      `Hi my handsome babyyy, you are so attractive in ways you don’t even realize. The way you laugh, your corny jokes (HAHAHAHA), and the way you make me feel safe just being myself. Everything about you feels special to me. I LOVE YOU BIG TIME!`,

      `I choose you. Over and over again. On good days and bad days, in calm moments and hard ones. You are important to me, and what we have is real and worth holding onto. I LOVE YOU SO MUCHHH, MY HUBBYY!!`,

      `Hi baby, I know we’re not good today. There are days we argue and days when things feel heavy. But one thing will never change—I will always love you. I will always choose to fix things with you, not walk away. You are the person I want to love forever.`,

Pa’no mapapa-cold yung fire? Edi baliktarin mo 🔥

Anong number ang nagpapanic? Edi UNOO 😭

Ano kasunod ng earth? Edi showtime 🤣

Anong tawag sa tissue na sweet? Edi imissue 🥹`
